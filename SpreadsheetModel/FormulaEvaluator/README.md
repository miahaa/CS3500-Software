# Comments to Evaluators:

I used Macbook so it was so hard to writing and submiting code. Everything seemed messed up when I 
tried to clone git and push my project. So I am not sure if I have any mistakes when setting up and 
submitting my assignment or not but I did try my best to submit in time. And I'm requesting a laptop from 
library but so far no available laptop. I'm sorry if I made any small mistakes in my work and hope you have 
a good day.

# Assignment Specific Topics
