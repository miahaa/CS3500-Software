# Overview of Assignment 2 - DependencyGraphTest

 This is a unit testing suite for the "DependencyGraph" class library, developed using MSTest in .NET Core 7. 
 This suite is designed to validate the functionality of the DependencyGraph library through formal unit testing. The approach follows the principles of Test Driven Development (TDD), where tests are written prior to the implementation of the actual functionality.
