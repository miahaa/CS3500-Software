# Comments to Evaluators
I had a hard time to do this assignment due to personal issues. I have 8 test cases that did not pass which is 
- TestUnknownVariable()
- TestExtraParentheses()
- TestInvalidVariable()
- TestPlusInvalidVariable()
- TestParensNoOperator()
- TestEmpty()
- TestComplexMultiVar()
  Moreover, I did not have time to refactor the code or apply any good pratices in software development.

# Assignment Specific Topics
In this assignment we will be focusing on how to take a more specific solution and make it more general.  Part of this process is turning a standalone static implementation into a more general reusable (dare we say more maintainable) solution.
After completing this assignment you will better be able to:
- bstract and generalize code so it becomes more functional and maintainable
- define, utilize/code with the Func notation in C# 
- define, utilize/code Immutable objects
- better read and implement non-trivial API specifications
- reinforce your understanding of Reference vs. Value equality.
